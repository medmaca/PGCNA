# PGCNA2 (Parsimonious Gene Correlation Network Analysis)

## Introduction

PGCNA is a gene correlation network analysis approach that is computationally simple yet yields stable and biologically meaningful modules and allows visualisation of very large networks, showing substructure and relationships that are normally hard to see.  The parsimonious approach, retaining the 3 most correlated edges per gene, results in a vast reduction in network complexity meaning that large networks can be clustered quickly and reduced to a small output file that can be used by downstream software.

## PGCNA and PGCNA2

There are two versions of PGCNA:

1.	**PGCNA**, the original version of PGCNA (used in the original [manuscript](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-019-0090-7)) : [PGCNA](https://github.com/medmaca/PGCNA/tree/master/PGCNA).
2.	**PGCNA2**, a version of PGCNA that uses an improved community detection alogorithm: [PGCNA2](https://github.com/medmaca/PGCNA/tree/master/PGCNA2).

We highly recommend using **PGCNA2**.
